/**
 *  A file-based mutual exclusion mechanism.
 *
 *  This class provides interprocess synchronisation based on
 *  `boost::interprocess::file_lock`, augmenting it with support for
 *  inter-fiber and inter-thread synchronisation.  This is achieved by
 *  combining the file lock with a lock on a global `shared_mutex` object
 *  associated with the file.
 *
 *  Note that a single `file_lock` object may only be used by one fiber at a
 *  time.  That is, if it is locked by one fiber, it must be unlocked by the
 *  same fiber.  Other fibers may not attempt to call its locking or unlocking
 *  functions in the meantime.
 *
 *  Furthermore, once a fiber has locked a file, the same fiber may not attempt
 *  to use a different `file_lock` object to lock the same file, as this would
 *  cause a deadlock.
 *
 *  Therefore, to synchronise between fibers (including those running in
 *  separate threads), it is recommended to create one and only one `file_lock`
 *  object associated with the same file in each fiber.  If, for some reason,
 *  a `file_lock` *must* be transferred between fibers, do so only when it is
 *  in the unlocked state.
 *
 *  The lock automatically gets unlocked on destruction.
 *
 *  The class meets the
 *  [Lockable](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Lockable)
 *  requirements.

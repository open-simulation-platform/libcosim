 *
 *  The meaning of the various fields is best illustrated with an example:
 *
 *  Let's say we have a "3D vector sum" function with two 3D input vectors
 *  and one 3D output vector.  Let's furthermore say that we implement
 *  these as two variable groups called `input` and `output`, listed in that
 *  order in `function_description::io_groups`.
 *
 *  We would then have two instances of the `input` group and one instance
 *  of the `output` group.  That is, their `function_io_group_description::count`
 *  values would be 2 and 1, respectively.  Each group would contain one
 *  variable with 3 instances (i.e., `function_io_description::count = 3`).
 *
 *  Now, to refer to the third component of the second input vector, we'd use:
 *
 *                            .-----------> first group, i.e., the input vectors
 *                            |  .--------> second instance of that group, i.e., the second input vector
 *                            |  |  .-----> first (and only) variable in the group
 *                            |  |  |  .--> third instance of that variable, i.e., the third component of the vector
 *      function_io_reference{0, 1, 0, 2}
 *
 *  Similarly, to refer to the second component of the first (and only) output
 *  vector, we'd use `function_io_reference{1, 0, 0, 1}`.

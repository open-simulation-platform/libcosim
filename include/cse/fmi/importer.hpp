/**
 *  Imports and caches FMUs.
 *
 *  The main purpose of this class is to read FMU files and create
 *  `cse::fmi::fmu` objects to represent them.  This is done with the
 *  `import()` function.
 *
 *  An `importer` object uses an on-disk cache that holds the unpacked
 *  contents of previously imported FMUs, so that they don't need to be
 *  unpacked anew every time they are imported.  This is a huge time-saver
 *  when large and/or many FMUs are loaded.  The path to this cache may be
 *  supplied by the user, in which case it is not automatically emptied on
 *  destruction.  Thus, if the same path is supplied each time, the cache
 *  becomes persistent between program runs.  It may be cleared manually
 *  by calling `clean_cache()`.
 *
 *  \warning
 *      Currently, there are no synchronisation mechanisms to protect the
 *      cache from concurrent use, so accessing the same cache from
 *      multiple instances/processes will likely cause problems.

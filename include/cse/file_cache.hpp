 *  each associated with a name â€“ here called a *key*, so as not to confuse
 *  it with the actual directory name, which may be different.
 *  (The actual filesystem layout of the cache is implementation specific.)
 *
 *  Client code can request read-write or read-only access to specific
 *  subdirectories.  Since it may be impossible for the implementation to
 *  restrict access on a filesystem level, it is up to client code to not
 *  abuse the API by modifying the contents of a subdirectory after
 *  requesting read-only access.

 *  A simulator interface for co-simulation algorithms.
 *
 *  This is the simulator interface exposed to `algorithm` implementers,
 *  and is used to control one "sub-simulator" in a co-simulation.
 *
 *  Some of the functions in this class, specifically the ones that return a
 *  `boost::fibers::future` object, are asynchronous.  Only one asynchronous
 *  operation may be executed per `simulator` object at any given time,
 *  meaning that client code must *always* ensure that the previous operation
 *  has completed before starting a new one. This is typically done by calling
 *  `boost::fibers::future::get()` on the future returned from the previous
 *  function call.
